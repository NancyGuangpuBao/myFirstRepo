    <h1>Hello I'm Nancy Bao</h1>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I am Nancy Bao and 23 years old. I am from China. I have already graduated from the Ohio State University with a bachelor’s degree in Economics in December 2019. I also minored in philosophy as my interest. I did a couple of internships when I was back
        in China during my summer breaks. Basically, my duties included applying economic and financial knowledge to real working situations either through teamwork and leadership or all effort by myself. I was also responsible for helping out seniors
        to guide different consumers with a variety of demands to certain offices. I also assisted with making basic account reconciliations by using different software, like Excel, Word, and PPT. I always have interest in and pay attention to the industry
        of economics and finance since I was young. So, that’s pretty much about me.
